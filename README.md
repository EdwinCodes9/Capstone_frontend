Welcome to the README section for my E-commerce React application! I built this app using the MERN stack and implemented a number of technologies to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience.

To handle server requests and responses, I utilized Axios, allowing for easy implementation of calls and puts for user, order, and message functionality. In addition to Axios, I also implemented Socket.io to enable real-time messaging functionality between users.

For styling, I chose to use Tailwind CSS, which offers extensive customization options and helps keep my codebase streamlined and efficient.

To handle payment processing, I utilized Stripe JS, a secure and reliable payment processing system that allows for seamless integration with my application. Additionally, to ensure secure user authentication, I used JWTokens, which helps prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

Finally, to help manage state across my application, I implemented Redux Toolkit, which offers a suite of powerful tools for handling state management in React applications.
